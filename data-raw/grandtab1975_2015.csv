The Feather River Survey does not provide separate estimates for fall and spring escapement.  Spring-run estimates are included with fall-run estimates.
","The river system can either be 1) Sacramento River, 2) San Joaquin River, or 3) Central Valley. The Central Valley River System is a combination of both the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Systems.","This field only applies to Fall-run counts in the Sacramento River System. There are three reaches: 1) Keswick Dam to Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD), 2) RBDD to Princeton Ferry, and 3) Princeton Ferry to Sacramento. ","Angler Harvest, Carcass, Hatchery, In-River Count, Snorkel, or Transfer.  When available, the carcass survey estimate is used instead of the snorkel survey estimate.  Hatchery estimates account for fish returning to a hatchery. Transfer estimates account for fish that are captured and transferred to a specified hatchery. In-River Count estimates fish escapements within the specified river, although the data collection type is not provided. ","The location of where the estimate or count was taken. In the Sacramento River Main Stem, the escapement estimate may include numbers of fish for tributaries where estimates were not made.",The location of the associated hatchery where either the estimate was taken or fish were transferred. ,The origin of fish that were transferred to a hatchery.,"When available, the specific location along the river is provided.
